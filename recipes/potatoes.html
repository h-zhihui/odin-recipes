    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="unlist">
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium to medium-large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, divided </li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more for serving</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the air fryer and potatoes:
                Preheat the air fryer to 390°F if your air fryer requires preheating. If your air fryer has multiple settings, use the “air fry” setting. 
                Wash and scrub the potatoes and pat them dry with a towel.
                Poke each potato all around about 16 times with a fork. Rub each potato with 3/4 teaspoon olive oil and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Air fry the potatoes:
                Place the potatoes into the basket of the air fryer, leaving about 1 inch between each potato.
                Return the basket to the fryer and cook at 390°F until the potatoes are fork tender and the skin is golden brown and crisp, 40 to 50 minutes, flipping each potato halfway through cooking.</li>
            <li>Serve:
                Remove the potatoes from the air fryer with a pair of tongs. Using a sharp knife, slice each potato through the top lengthwise (without cutting all the way through) to reveal the steamy interior. 
                Use a fork to fluff the insides of the potato. Season and top as desired with more salt, freshly ground black pepper, unsalted butter, shredded sharp cheddar, sour cream, and/or scallions. Serve immediately while the insides are still hot and the skin is still crispy. </li>
